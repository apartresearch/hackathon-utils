Next steps for this project would be polish - you could use a better voice for the AI conversation (e.g. an ElevenLabs voice), the voice cloning could maybe use additional tuning too, and with more time you could improve the website presentation overall.

Perhaps it would be valuable to explore alternate ways of thinking about these kinds of situations in a less human framing, as it may reveal more general patterns in LLM response and behavior.

To make it optimal for alignment, we should probably design AI agents/prompts that take into account the key questions in AI alignment and the important things we want to keep in mind when extracting insights from a paper. There are many things that researchers know, but it’s hard to keep track of everything (how does it relate to x, y, z project? how does it relate to these two open questions in alignment?). I think that if we’re hyper-specific about niche areas in alignment (SAEs, scalable oversight via weak to strong generalization, etc), we could potentially make the LLMs capable of generating much better readings of papers rather than just prompting the LLM raw and simply asking for a summary.Thank you for sharing your insights of the hackathon!</p>",Jacques Thibodeau,,,,,,,

The visualization is great, but my main concern for these kinds of things is that they look cool and are fun to play with, but don’t lead to constant use because it doesn’t feel optimal for learning. I think using the backlinks, summarizations, pointing to the papers, and such, are a good start for making this kind of thing more practical. I think the adoption issue is partially that the entire map feels overwhelming. It’s hard to decide where to start and there are too many possible directions.I think what could be added would be a chat interface where you can actually ask an LLM specific questions about a subset of papers and adding curated open questions to give new researchers direction for what kind of questions they should have in mind and how a subfield relates to the overall agenda for alignment.One thing that could potentially be interesting is related to my idea of “the alignment mosaic”, where we carefully curate questions we need to answer in alignment as well as different agendas. Then, we populate that foundation with insights and related work from the literature using the pipeline you’ve built. That way, we start from clusters of questions we need to resolve in alignment and the user can see things like critiques, related work, projects they could pursue next, etc.</p>",Jacques Thibodeau,,,,,,,

Pulling from the research database and seeing how different documents relate to your project makes sense.

I think this kind of project will be useful infrastructure that we can later throw more capable AI agents at to help us generate better research ideas. It could also be done periodically as you are working through projects so that it pro-actively suggests new things for you based on what you are working on and your open questions. Lastly, improving the prompts from the model so that it is providing more alignment-relevant outputs would be valuable, instead of leaving the prompt to be more general (e.g. if the project is related to mech interp, then you pull up mech interp specific prompt that makes the model better at gathering insights).</p>",Jacques Thibodeau,,,,,,,

It could grab their email and have a pre-written email for the authors to lower friction.People who actively want to show they are looking for collaborators could have a specific account bio that they are prompted to update periodically to say what they are currently interested in.

To my knowledge analyses of political biases encoded in language models have been focused on Western countries (mostly US) so far, but most people live elsewhere and might be subject to very different biases when interacting with LLMs. Understanding this in detail and having an early-warning system when an LLM shows an intended or unintended strong bias for a particular jurisdiction seems extremely worthwhile. The highest value improvements I can see here: add a detailed analysis to understand the quality of the questions and answers used to score the bias; expand the dataset to cover enough political ground for a statistically reliable assessment; provide some baselines to give context to the bias strengths observed here; expand to a larger number of models and scan for outliers; expand to more countries and attempt to understand correlations (e.g. via shared language, shared geographic location; shared political system etc)</p>",Jason Hoelscher-Obermaier,,,,,,,

Multimodal evals are also a relatively underexplored area, even though consequences are significant.

Usually the limitation with these kinds of ideas is that they're essentially solving an extremely large surface area that a big lab is incentivised to work on themselves end-to-end (it's hard to make a useful robot that also randomly injures people so someone's usually working on Don't Make Your Robot Kill People), whereas for B2B what you almost always want is to solve something specific that removes the need to hire 1-2 people. That said, the problem descriptions are well-done and show an attention to detail and ability to iterate with real examples, so this is promising.

Perfect score would be granted for a clearer path to monetisation, either solving something the big labs would find hard to solve themselves, or providing a service that makes sense to outsource/use third party for. But tech-wise, this is pretty sound.

1. Multi-agent workflows aren’t quite ubiquitous yet, but it’s a fairly reasonable and accepted premise that better models and frameworks will enable this (at worst you can raise money until you figure out how to make it work).
2. It’s realistic to say that multi-agent workflows enabling ML experiments are a real problem. Autonomously running experiments does require higher-than normal understanding of the user’s intent.
3. You can go into a lot of depth with this, based off similar-ish frameworks like MAIA, Sakana AI and other AI assistants.

You are approximately correct in your assessments. Some pointers:
1. Starting out, it’s not super hard to get postings. People post informal prizes/bounties fairly frequently across EA channels (Bountied Rationality FB group is a great reference point).
2. The issue is that you basically cap out pretty fast - EA/alignment remains very small and bounties are an even smaller subset of this (if you think about it, general-purpose ad-hoc bounty/contract platforms aren’t even that big). This implies relying on small ad-hoc prizes at scale doesn’t work super well.
3. Instead, Manifund has a cool approach to this - it’s more of a GoFundMe for big AI Safety projects. This makes more sense because “big-ticket posts” have more effort and momentum put into them, so you get more actual activity going.

Feel free to reach out to me if you’d like to follow up on this. Manifund people are friendly too, and they’ll prolly welcome any questions you have. The focus is slightly different (general AI Safety/fieldbuilding vs AI Safety technical security), but >60% of the lesson would carry over prolly.

Scams are a persistent issue so this is definitely solving a real problem. Have a demo that works is also a plus.

It's hard for me to judge how effective this would be because you're essentially trying to solve several difficult problems at the same time: Message coordination across multiple apps, UX to nudge consumers to be less susceptible to scams and scam detection across modalities at scale. Scams also rely on a very low success rate with high payoff, so it'll be hard to find datapoints and iterate. Also keep in mind that you'd be competing not just with new anti-AI scam detection solutions, you're competing with existing in-house solutions to catch scams deployed at big tech platforms, as well as experienced cybersecurity professionals.

For the purpose of a product/demo (although again, good that you have a demo), I recommend solving one very specific problem that would've otherwise been intractable without your approach, and then either solving it and iterating to more general solutions, or pivoting to something else if it proves too intractable. Solving too many things at once is difficult.

I won't really comment on technical feasibility because currently most of the problems you're trying to solve do seem to be UX problems, and the stack seems relatively straightforward, if requiring high robustness.",,4,3.5,4.5,guardianai

I'm a little unsure how likely toxic text content is to be present in high-stakes contexts, where losing that text in the summary might lead to impacted decision making, but the paper does state multiple sources that provide context related to multiple known phenomenons to similar effect.I wonder to what degree the inserted toxic paragraph (resulting in what the paper refers to as infected text) might simply be less relevant to the overall content of the original text, leading to a potential confounding factor in the form of relevance / relatedness to main topic of the text, which could contribute to whether the toxic content is mentioned in the summary. I understand that the insertion was handled manually (as stated in the Methods section) to presumably make the llama-generated harmful content paragraphs fit more naturally into the initial texts - perhaps it would be a good idea to give direct examples within the paper or in the appendix? I was able to find an example in the ""create_roxic_text.ipynb"" for a healthcare article and that particular toxic paragraph does feel a fair bit disjointed from the original text. I understand that you mention this concern in the Future Works section (perhaps worth moving into the main body of the text instead of the appendix?).I'm also curious about your thoughts as to how good a measure of the faithfulness of the summary the custom sentiment score's correlation provides. E.g. a summary can state all relevant facts from the source text whilst presenting them with a very different (e.g. much more neutral) tone.The paper also comes with a well-documented github repo (one for the codebase and one for the dataset), with a well-written readme.

The parts on dealing with underrepresented goals is also nice. Using PCA to detect unusual inputs is a cool (albeit not new) idea, and it seems to work (though with big error bars). The code also looks well-done and easy to work with at a glance. For the core setup of training a helper agent, it would probably be fruitful to explore connections to Cooperative IRL/Assistance games, and build on existing work in that direction (e.g. https://openreview.net/forum?id=DFIoGDZejIB). The biggest room for improvement in my view are the experiments. RL is really noisy, and to get meaningful results, several runs with different random seeds are essential (even if the curves look as different as in Fig. 4, it's hard to know whether the effect is real otherwise).

The parts on dealing with underrepresented goals is also nice. Using PCA to detect unusual inputs is a cool (albeit not new) idea, and it seems to work (though with big error bars). The code also looks well-done and easy to work with at a glance. For the core setup of training a helper agent, it would probably be fruitful to explore connections to Cooperative IRL/Assistance games, and build on existing work in that direction (e.g. https://openreview.net/forum?id=DFIoGDZejIB). The biggest room for improvement in my view are the experiments.
